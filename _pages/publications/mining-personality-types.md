###### Abstract
This study enables graduating high school students to choose an area of specialization in college based on their personal interest. This can be done through a Holland Code personality assessment test developed by Dr. John L. Holland [1]. Furthermore, this study is intended also to guide the school administrators in strategic planning and to enhance decision-making process. The personality assessment test will serve as a tool in generating test results that will be used for extracting patterns together with the students’ profiles. The extraction can be accomplished through mining frequent patterns and association rule generation using the known apriori algorithm, which is used to uncover frequent itemsets through candidate generation [2]. The system generates frequent type of students associated to a type of personality and an area of specialization in college. Taking advantage of the said tool and method, the researchers was able to develop a system that will guide both graduating high school students and school administrators in making decisions.
