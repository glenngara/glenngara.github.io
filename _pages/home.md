I am an Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Engineer of [SpeechTherapy.Ai](https://lifetimefluency.com) (formerly Lifetime Fluency), where I am presently developing an artificial intelligence for speech problem detection. At the same time, I am an Assistant Professor at the [University of the Immaculate Conception, College of Computer Studies](https://www.uic.edu.ph/ite). In 2017, I started my journey as a PhD Computer Science student and researcher at [De La Salle University-Manila](https://www.dlsu.edu.ph) and [DLSU Center for Complexity and Emerging Technologies](https://comet.dlsu.edu.ph), respectively. At the lab, I conduct research on the structure and dynamics of a research collaboration network through structural analysis and network visualization.

My PhD dissertation is currently in the works, which is about the theory and development of a shallow neural network architecture and an incremental learning algorithm.

I am passionate about Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, and their application in machine vision and complex networks. I am also motivated to helping people build data-driven solutions even without a machine learning background.
